# StickyNotesApp_React-Native 😇📝

### A hybrid application build using JavaScript and React-Native. This application is a kind of keep-notes 📝 app where you can keep your todo's and make notes for future use. The application uses online Realtime Database of Google Firebase to store the notes and todo's of the user.

### Topics I have covered while building the application:-
- Class component in React-Native.
- State variables in React-Native.
- setState() function in React-Native.
- Custom components in React-Native.
- Arrays in React-Native.
- map() function in React-Native.
- splice() funtion for arrays in JavaScript.
- Google Firebase.
- Realtime Database of Google Firebase.
